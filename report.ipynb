    "### INTRODUCTION:\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### AIM :\n",
    "This project aims to reproduce the results of the DistilBERT (Sanh et al. 2019) [1] paper for binary text classification on the SST-2 dataset, achieving an accuracy of approximately 91% as reported. Additional goal of the project is also to make a significant contribution by enhancing the model's performance on the IMDb dataset [6] through an upgraded methodology. By leveraging GPU acceleration, we aim to imporove accuracy. The project demonstrates DistilBERT's effectiveness for sentiment analysis tasks and compares it to other models such as TF-IDF [3] and Word2Vec [4].\n",

    "#### DESCRIPTION OF PAPER:\n",
    "The paper, \"DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter\" by Sanh et al. (2019), introduces DistilBERT, a compressed transformer model that retains 97% of BERT’s[2] language understanding capabilities while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. It achieves this through knowledge distillation, transferring BERT’s knowledge to a smaller architecture with fewer layers and parameters. Evaluated on the GLUE benchmark, including the SST-2 task for binary sentiment classification, DistilBERT attains ~91% accuracy, showcasing its efficiency for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The paper’s implementation is provided via the Hugging Face Transformers library, which we use to replicate and extend its methodology.\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### PROBLEM STATEMENT :\n",
    "While DistilBERT offers a lightweight alternative to BERT, its performance on diverse datasets and sensitivity to hyperparameters remain underexplored, particularly for larger and more complex texts beyond the GLUE benchmark. The challenge is to validate DistilBERT’s reported SST-2 accuracy and improve its accuracy on a new dataset like IMDb, which features longer movie reviews, by optimizing its fine-tuning process. This requires addressing potential underfitting, capturing richer context, and ensuring computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM:\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is critical in NLP, with applications in customer feedback, social media monitoring and content recommendation. However, large models like BERT demand significant computational resources, limiting their accessibility for resource-constrained environments, such as academic research or edge devices. DistilBERT addresses this by offering a faster, smaller model, but its generalization to datasets like IMDb—where reviews are longer and more nuanced than SST-2’s short sentences—needs validation. Improving accuracy on such datasets enhances DistilBERT’s practical utility, especially for real-world scenarios requiring precise sentiment classification on varied text lengths.\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### SOLUTION:\n",
    "To reproduce the DistilBERT paper’s results, we fine-tune distilbert-base-uncased on the SST-2 dataset using the Hugging Face Transformers library, following the paper’s methodology (3 epochs, learning rate 2e-5, batch size 32) to achieve \\~91% accuracy.For our contribution, we test DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset, introducing an enhanced configuration to improve accuracy from \\~91% to \\~91.3%. This involves increasing the sequence length to 256 tokens, using different parameter combinations such as learning rate of 2e5 and 5e5 and dropout rate of 0.1 and 0.2. Leveraging GPU accelerates training (\\~48 minutes for SST-2, \\~2 hours for IMDb experiments), ensuring efficiency. This upgraded methodology demonstrates DistilBERT’s robustness and scalability, fulfilling the project’s goal of advancing the paper’s findings.\n"

    "| Reference | Explanation | Dataset/Input | Weakness |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------|\n",
    "| Sanh et al. (2019). *DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter.* | Introduces DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer model created via knowledge distillation from BERT. It has 40% fewer parameters, runs 60% faster, and retains 97% of BERT’s performance. Fine-tuned on GLUE tasks (e.g., SST-2: ~91% accuracy), it balances efficiency and accuracy for NLP tasks like sentiment classification. | GLUE benchmark (e.g., SST-2: short sentences for binary sentiment), general text corpora for pretraining (e.g., Wikipedia, BookCorpus). | Limited exploration of long-text datasets (e.g., IMDb reviews). Fewer layers (6 vs. BERT’s 12) may reduce capacity for complex tasks. Hyperparameter sensitivity not fully detailed, requiring tuning for new datasets. |\n",
    "| Devlin et al. (2018). *BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding.* | Presents BERT, a bidirectional transformer pretrained on masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction. Fine-tuned on GLUE tasks (e.g., SST-2: ~93%), it set new benchmarks for NLP but is computationally heavy. DistilBERT builds on BERT’s architecture. | GLUE benchmark, large corpora (Wikipedia, BookCorpus) for pretraining. Input: tokenized text sequences (max 512 tokens). | High computational cost (110M parameters, slow inference). Large memory footprint limits use on consumer hardware (e.g., M1 Pro without CUDA). Overkill for simpler tasks where DistilBERT suffices. |\n",
    "| Pedregosa et al. (2011). *Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python.* (TF-IDF baseline) | Describes TF-IDF, a traditional NLP method that vectorizes text based on term frequency and inverse document frequency, often paired with classifiers like Logistic Regression. Used as a baseline in our project (IMDb: 88% accuracy), it’s simple and fast for sentiment analysis. | IMDb dataset (25,000 reviews), general text inputs (bag-of-words). | Lacks contextual understanding (e.g., word order, semantics), leading to lower accuracy (88% vs. DistilBERT’s 94%). Struggles with nuanced sentiment (e.g., sarcasm). Sensitive to preprocessing (e.g., stop words). |\n",
    "| Mikolov et al. (2013). *Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality.* (Word2Vec baseline) | Introduces Word2Vec, which generates static word embeddings via skip-gram or CBOW models. In our project, averaged Word2Vec embeddings with Logistic Regression achieved 81% accuracy on IMDb, providing a baseline to DistilBERT’s contextual embeddings. | IMDb dataset, pretrained embeddings (e.g., Google News 300D). Input: tokenized text for embedding averaging. | Static embeddings miss context (e.g., “good” vs. “not good”), yielding lower accuracy (81%). Averaging embeddings loses sentence structure. Less effective for long texts like IMDb reviews compared to transformers. |\n",

    "#### TF-IDF and Word2Vec\n",
    "* TF-IDF’s 88% accuracy was strong for a traditional method, leveraging word frequency effectively but missing contextual depth.\n",
    "* Word2Vec’s 81% accuracy underperformed, likely due to static embeddings losing sentiment nuances in long reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtime\n",
    "GPU reduced training time by ~2-5x compared to CPU estimates (~3 hours for SST-2, ~8 hours for IMDb on CPU), critical for iterative experimentation within the project timeline.\n",

    "### Conclusion and Future Direction :\n",
    "*******************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Learnings :\n",
    "This project provided valuable insights into transformer-based NLP and practical model optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "DistilBERT’s Efficiency: DistilBERT balances performance and resource demands, making it ideal for academic projects on consumer hardware, unlike heavier models (e.g., BERT).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Small changes (e.g., learning rate 2e-5 to 3e-5, sequence length 128 to 256) significantly affect accuracy, emphasizing the need for systematic tuning.\n",
    "* Dataset Differences: IMDb’s longer, more nuanced reviews required different configurations (e.g., longer sequences, more epochs) than SST-2’s concise sentences, highlighting dataset-specific optimization.\n",
    "* GPU Acceleration: The GPU support enabled rapid experimentation, underscoring the importance of hardware acceleration in deep learning workflows.\n",
    "* Reproducibility: Following the paper’s methodology (via Hugging Face Transformers) ensured reliable results.\n",
    "* Time Management: Iterative testing within a tight deadline  taught prioritization of impactful changes (e.g., focusing on best_config).\n",
    "*******************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Results Discussion :\n",
    "The results validate the DistilBERT paper’s claims and demonstrate an enhanced methodology for sentiment analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reproduction Success: Achieving 91.3% on SST-2 confirms DistilBERT’s reported performance ~91%, aligning with the paper’s methodology (Sanh et al., 2019, Section 4.1). This establishes a robust baseline, proving the model’s reliability for binary classification on short texts.\n",
    "* Contribution Significance: The IMDb experiments improved accuracy from 91% to 91.3% in best_config, a ~0.34% gain. This enhancement stems from capturing more review context (256 tokens vs. 128), optimizing learning dynamics and extending training and dropout rates. These changes generalize DistilBERT to longer texts, addressing the problem of applying lightweight models to complex datasets.\n",
    "* Comparison: The best_config accuracy ~91.3% shows DistilBERT’s potential with proper tuning, despite being 40% smaller. It performs far better than other models such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec.\n",
    "* Practical Implications: Higher IMDb accuracy enhances DistilBERT’s utility for real-world sentiment analysis (e.g., movie review platforms), where nuanced texts dominate. The model's efficiency suggests such models are accessible to students and small teams.\n",
    "*******************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Limitations :\n",
    "Despite the project’s success, several limitations exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hardware Constraints: The consumer GPU while efficient is slower than dedicated GPUs.\n",
    "* Sequence Length Trade-off: The best_config used 256 tokens, but IMDb reviews often exceed 500 tokens. Truncation still occurred, possibly capping accuracy below potential.\n",
    "* Hyperparameter Scope: Only a few parameters were tested (learning rate, dropout, epochs). Exhaustive grid search (e.g., weight decay, optimizer types) could further optimize results but was infeasible due to time constraints.\n",
    "* Dataset Bias: IMDb’s balanced labels (50% positive, 50% negative) may not reflect real-world distributions, limiting generalizability to imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "* Single Model: Focused on distilbert-base-uncased, omitting comparisons with larger models (e.g., bert-base-uncased) or specialized variants (e.g., distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2) due to runtime limits.\n",
    "* Evaluation Metrics: Relied solely on accuracy, omitting precision, recall, or F1-score, which could reveal nuanced performance gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "*******************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Future Extension :\n",
    "To build on this project, the following extensions are proposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Longer Sequences: Increase sequence length to 512 tokens (DistilBERT’s max), potentially reaching higher accuracy.\n",
    "* Advanced Models: Test bert-base-uncased or roberta-base for higher accuracy comparing trade-offs in speed and resources.\n",
    "* Hyperparameter Search: Conduct grid search over learning rates (1e-5 to 5e-5), weight decay (0.01-0.1), and warmup ratios.\n",
    "* Diverse Datasets: Apply DistilBERT to other sentiment datasets (e.g., Yelp, Twitter) to test generalization across text lengths and domains.\n",
    "* Metric Expansion: Include precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance on imbalanced subsets, enhancing robustness.\n",
    "* Ensemble Methods: Combine DistilBERT with other lightweight models like ALBERT."
